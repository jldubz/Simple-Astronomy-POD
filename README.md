This application was developed as a sample application for the LinkedIn Learning/Lynda.com course [Android Development Essential Training: Distributing Apps](https://www.lynda.com/course-tutorials/Android-Development-Essential-Training-Distributing-Apps/784296-2.html)

This course is the final course in the [Android Mobile App Developer Learning Course](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Developer/become-an-android-mobile-app-developer) and covers the process for packaging and distributing your Android app to the Google Play Store and the Amazon App Store.

Once you've created an Android app, it's time to share it with the world. Luckily, there are many avenues to distribution. This course focuses on the two primary channels: Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. The first step is to prepare your app, including cleaning up and optimizing code. Then you can learn how to package a signed application file for distribution and configure multiple variants with different features. Instructor Jon-Luke West—a product engineer who creates Android and iOS apps for a variety of markets—walks you through each step involved in getting your app into Google Play and Amazon, including creating graphics, setting pricing and product details, and publishing the app. He also shows how to track its success after release with the built-in reporting features offered by both stores, which cover everything from user feedback to crash statistics.

Topics include:
* Exploring the distribution options
* Cleaning up your code
* Building a signed APK file
* Configuring build types and variants
* Distributing through Google Play
* Adding app graphics
* Setting pricing
* Publishing the app in Google Play
